# pythonesque
On my road to Monty Python 
Yes it was a time I started to learn python, after awhile I decided to continue learning python 
Basically, Python is smart and seems to be like the swiss-knife of any programming beginner, so I will suggest to any newcomer, to start with python cause it's synthax is pretty simple and enough explicit, ofcourse this is only in few learning days, cause after you hear about regex and the way you set up a pattern finder.... 

Yes I can add this directly from command line which python okay can do also
You are awesome....

This is pathetic and starting to be really strange for me.

But what about if I start to create some branches everywhere on this file and try to merge them after certain changes occurs...

And Here the master branch is continuing it's way like nothing has occured elsewhere in the world.
